## Work Experience: ##  


**Founder - *Chiral Crafts LLC, May 2020 - Present***

- Since I'm attemtping to make a pretty radical career change (from 10 years of chef-dom to now hopefully a research astrophysicist), I started this small company for some freelance work outside of my studies/attempts to strengthen my graduate school application
- So far, I've done commissioned metalwork (some [wine bar shelving](/images/all_together_now.png) and knife sharpening, but hope to expand into making custom furniture and development work/data visualization

**Chef Instructor - *Escoffier Culinary Arts, May 2020 - May 2021***

- Managed multiple classes (100+ students each class)
- Led interactive live sessions over Zoom to impart culinary and cultural knowledge
- Provided personalized video feedback for each student's weekly cooking assignment
- Taught world cuisine, focusing on importance of understanding one another through our food
- Held tutoring sessions focusing on restaurant/business math
- Developed Excel spreadsheets to streamline tracking student progress (weekly assignment submissions, participation, etc.) - data pulled from Moodle CMS, Salesforce, and Sisense
- Created a simple grade tracking spreadsheet for student use (Moodle lacked an option to explore possible grade outcomes with differently weighted assignments and quizzes)
- Increased student engagement by holding quarterly cooking challenges with prizes, students would have to design and cost an effective menu, then the class would vote to select the winners (prizes were cookbooks/cooking utensils)
