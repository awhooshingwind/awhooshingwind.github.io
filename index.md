I had spent the better part of my adult life working in kitchens. This afforded me an opportunity to travel the world, to taste all kinds of amazing ingredients, to make wonderful memories - all while honing a terribly useful skill - to prepare delicious food.

But keeping step with a restaurant lifestyle became too frenetic; over the shutdown, I enrolled at Tacoma Community College for some prerequisite maths. Now, I am finishing a BS in Physics at Washington State University, where I've been working with Dr. Engels' research group.

I intend next to pursue a PhD, then, a career in experimental research.
