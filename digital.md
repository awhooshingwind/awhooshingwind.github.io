- Created various stable, mechanically-mixed emulsions, with and without phospholipid assistance (hollandaise and other sauce work)
- Explored hydration and agitation of wheat proteins for optimal gluten structures (hand making fresh pasta daily)
- Utilized various chemicals and enzymes to cultivate sanitary (and tasty) environments for food preservation, such as salt and nitrites for various proteins (bacon, pastrami, beet-based pastrami) and lactic acids from produce cultivated onsite (kimchi, various pickles and krauts)
- Continued a decade's worth of research into Maillard reactions in various animal proteins, herbaceous plants, and fruits
- With many iterations, craft a pretty dope chilaquiles recipe

###### Founder - *Chiral Crafts LLC, May 2020 - Present*

- I started this small company for freelance work. So far, [commissioned metalwork](/metal.md) and loads of knife/tool sharpening, but expanding into custom furniture along with some development, particularly data visualization 

###### Chef Instructor - *Escoffier Culinary Arts, May 2020 - May 2021*

- Led interactive live sessions over Zoom to impart culinary and cultural knowledge
- Provided personalized video feedback for each student's weekly cooking assignment
- Taught multiple sections of world cuisine (100+ students in each), focusing on importance of understanding one another through our food
- Held tutoring sessions for restaurant/business math & writing
- Developed Excel spreadsheets for tracking student progress (weekly assignment submissions, participation, etc.) - data pulled from Moodle CMS, Salesforce, and Sisense
- Created a simple [grade tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTIHyR0CUrAtPCjrw08osnoBhqA_n8aNh5CT9zqhMIU/edit?usp=sharing) for student use (The company's custom LMS lacked any convenient, **simple** way for students to track their grade,this was for the many ESL/older students who struggled with the Moodle web interface overall)
- Increased student engagement with cooking challenges, students would have to design and cost an effective menu, class would vote for winner (prizes of cookbooks/cooking utensils)
