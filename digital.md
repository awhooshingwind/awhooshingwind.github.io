##### Work Experience: 

###### Culinary Engineer - *Doe Bay Caf√©, Snooze an A.M Eatery, et. al, June 2009 - March 2022*

- Created various stable, mechanically-mixed emulsions, with and without phospholipid assistance (hollandaise and other sauce work)
- Explored hydration and agitation of wheat proteins for optimal gluten structures (hand making fresh pasta daily)
- Utilized various chemicals and enzymes to cultivate sanitary (and tasty) environments for food preservation:
    - Salt and nitrites for various proteins - bacon, lardo, pastrami(both beet and beef based)
    - Salt, lactic and/or acetic acids for fresh produce (sour fruits, kimchi, myriad pickles and condiments)
- Continued a decade's worth of research into Maillard reactions in different animal proteins, herbaceous plants, and fruits
- After many iterations, crafted a pretty dope chilaquiles recipe
- Plus much, much more. Will gladly go into additional detail, but I reckon I could **still** land a kitchen stage, even with this outdated (2020) <a href="https://awhooshingwind.github.io/projects/JakeResume.pdf" target="_blank">kitchen resume</a>, if I had the mind to..
  

###### Founder - *Chiral Crafts LLC, January 2021 - Present*

- I started this small company for my own freelance work
- Mostly that's meant, <a href="https://awhooshingwind.github.io/metal.html" target="_blank">commissioned metalwork</a> and loads of knife/tool sharpening, but expanding into custom furniture along with some development work, particularly data visualization

###### Chef Instructor - *Escoffier Culinary Arts, May 2020 - May 2021*

- Led interactive live sessions over Zoom to impart culinary and cultural knowledge
- Provided personalized video feedback for each student's weekly cooking assignments
- Taught multiple sections of world cuisine (100+ students in each), focusing on importance of understanding one another through our food
- Held tutoring sessions for writing & restaurant/business math
- Wrote Python scripts to streamline our weekly reporting process (scraped data from Salesforce, Moodle, Sisense into student progress tracking workbook)
- Created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTIHyR0CUrAtPCjrw08osnoBhqA_n8aNh5CT9zqhMIU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">grade tracking spreadsheet</a> for student use (The company's custom LMS lacked any convenient, **simple** way for students to track their grade,I made this for the many ESL/older students who struggled with the Moodle web interface overall)
- Boosted student engagement with contests, students would design and cost an effective menu, class would vote for winner (prizes of cookbooks/cooking utensils)
