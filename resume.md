### Jacob Pierson

I find myself at a crossroads [digital](/digital.md) | [analog](/analog.md)

I have spent the last decade working in kitchens. This has allowed me to travel the world, taste some delicious ingredients, it's been a truly extraordinary experience. And while food will always be my passion, science has fueled my curiosity since I was a boy. 

So, I am attemting a new challenge - to apply the skills I've honed to a STEM field. I've picked up quite the bag of tricks, I'd love an opportunity to work with you.
